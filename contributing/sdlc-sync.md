# SDLC Sync Guide

This guide explains how SDLC tooling is shared from the **cluster module** (source) to other modules (destinations like `atlas-azure`).

## How It Works

The cluster module defines shared tooling in [`.github/sdlc.src.yaml`](../.github/sdlc.src.yaml). The `path-sync` tool copies files one-way from cluster to destination modules.

```
cluster (source) ──sync──> atlas-azure (destination)
                 ──sync──> other-module (destination)
```

Changes to shared tooling must be made in the cluster repository. Destination modules receive updates through sync.

## What Gets Synced

| Category | Paths | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Python tooling | `tools/{changelog,docs,release,workspace}/` and selected `tools/dev/` files | `dev_vars.py` is scaffolded once, then destination-owned |
| Workflows | `.github/workflows/` | `code-health.yml` has per-job section markers |
| Config | `justfile`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `.terraform-docs.yml` | `justfile` has section markers |
| GitHub | `.github/CODEOWNERS`, `pull_request_template.md`, `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` | |

**Scaffolded once, then destination-owned:**

- `tools/dev/dev_vars.py` - workspace paths and test file patterns.
- `docs/examples.yaml` - example configuration.
- `docs/inputs_groups.yaml` - README input grouping.

**Not synced:**

- `cleanup-test-env.yml` and `dev-integration-test.yml`.

## Sync Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `sync` (default) | Copy if destination missing or source newer |
| `replace` | Always overwrite destination |
| `scaffold` | Copy only when the destination path is missing; the destination owns later changes |

## Section Markers

Section markers allow mixing shared and module-specific content within synced files. They work in both `justfile` and workflow files like `code-health.yml`.

### Basic Sections

```makefile
# === OK_EDIT: path-sync header ===
# Module-specific configuration (preserved during sync)
PLAN_TEST_FILES := "-filter=tests/plan_validations.tftest.hcl ..."

# === DO_NOT_EDIT: path-sync standard ===
# Shared recipes (replaced during sync)
pre-commit: fmt validate lint check-docs py-check
    @echo "Pre-commit checks passed"

# === OK_EDIT: path-sync standard ===
# Module-specific recipes below (not synced)
```

| Section | Marker | Behavior |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Header | `OK_EDIT: path-sync header` | Module-specific variables, preserved |
| Standard | `DO_NOT_EDIT: path-sync standard` | Shared recipes, replaced |

### Resumable Sections (Workflows)

Resumable sections allow user-editable gaps within a managed section. The same section ID can pause (`OK_EDIT`) and resume (`DO_NOT_EDIT`):

```yaml
# === DO_NOT_EDIT: path-sync job-snapshot-tests ===
plan-snapshot-tests:
  name: Terraform Examples Plan Snapshot Tests
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
# === OK_EDIT: path-sync job-snapshot-tests ===
  env:
    # User-managed: Add cloud provider credentials
    MONGODB_ATLAS_CLIENT_ID: ${{ secrets.MONGODB_ATLAS_CLIENT_ID }}
# === DO_NOT_EDIT: path-sync job-snapshot-tests ===
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
# === OK_EDIT: path-sync job-snapshot-tests ===
```

**Behavior**:
- Managed parts (between `DO_NOT_EDIT` and `OK_EDIT`) are synced from source
- Gap content (between `OK_EDIT` and next `DO_NOT_EDIT` of same ID) is preserved in destination
- New files use source gap content as boilerplate/template

### Workflow Sections (code-health.yml)

The `code-health.yml` workflow uses per-job section markers:

| Section ID | Job | Notes |
|------------|-----|-------|
| `triggers` | - | Workflow triggers (on: push, PR, etc.) |
| `job-check` | `check` | Code quality validation |
| `job-py-tests` | `py-tests` | Shared Python tooling tests |
| `job-plan-tests` | `plan-tests` | Terraform unit plan tests |
| `job-compat-tests` | `compat-tests` | Terraform CLI version compatibility |
| `job-snapshot-tests` | `plan-snapshot-tests` | Version selection and plan snapshots with resumable gaps for env vars and commands |
| `job-slack` | `slack-notification` | Slack notification on failure |

**Gradual enablement**: New repos can use `skip_sections` to exclude jobs not yet ready:

```yaml
# sdlc.src.yaml
destinations:
  - name: gcp
    skip_sections:
      .github/workflows/code-health.yml: [triggers, job-snapshot-tests]
```

Skip `triggers` and `job-snapshot-tests` together when a destination retains a legacy snapshot job
or workflow inputs. This prevents shared triggers from removing inputs required by the
destination-owned job. Remove both skips in the same onboarding change and re-sync.

Skipping a section prevents path-sync from adding or updating it; it does not disable an existing
destination section.

Before enabling the section, set `MONGODB_ATLAS_PROVIDER_MIN_VERSION` to an exact supported release
in the destination-owned environment gap. Preserve the destination's credentials, setup, and
snapshot commands in the `OK_EDIT` gaps. See [test-guide.md](./test-guide.md) for lane behavior.

Import validation (`justfile` section `import-validate`, workflow section `job-import-validate`) is enabled for cluster (source) and project by default. Other destinations skip those sections until they opt in.

## For Destination Module Developers

**Do not modify synced files directly.** Changes will be overwritten on next sync.

### Change Request Options

| Option | Approach | When to use |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| SRC first | PR in cluster repo, wait for sync | Default, maintains single source of truth |
| Dual PR | PR in both azure and cluster (ignore failed validation) | Urgent fixes |
| Opt-out file | Remove path-sync header from file | File becomes DEST-owned, no future syncs |
| Opt-out section | Add section marker in SRC, use `skip_sections` in DEST config | Partial opt-out |

### Module-Specific Configuration

Edit these files freely (not synced):
- `tools/dev/dev_vars.py` - workspace paths and test file patterns
- `docs/examples.yaml` - example table configuration
- `docs/inputs_groups.yaml` - variable groupings

### Adding Module-Specific CI

Create workflows with unique names. Only files matching sync patterns are overwritten:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/my-module-test.yml
# Module-specific workflow - not managed by sync
name: My Module Test
on: [push]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

## Running the Sync

From the cluster repository:

```bash
just sdlc-sync-dry  # Preview changes
just sdlc-sync      # Apply sync
```

Destination verification runs before pull request creation. Failures are reported but do not block
pull request creation, so resolve them before merging.

## Testing Changes (Source Developers)

To validate synced files work before merging source changes:

1. Create PR in cluster repo with the changes
2. Run `just sdlc-sync` locally (or trigger workflow dispatch from PR branch)
3. Review the changes in DEST repos - their CI will validate the changes
4. If DEST CI passes, merge SRC PR, then commit DEST changes

## Why One-Way Sync?

- **Single source of truth:** Cluster team owns shared tooling
- **No merge conflicts:** One-way flow eliminates reconciliation
- **Simpler upgrades:** Update once, sync everywhere
