# MongoDB Atlas Project Module (Public Preview)


## Public Preview Note

The MongoDB Atlas Project Module (Public Preview) simplifies Project deployments and embeds MongoDB's best practices as intelligent defaults. This preview validates that these patterns meet the needs of most workloads without constant maintenance or rework. We welcome your feedback and contributions during this preview phase. MongoDB formally supports this module from its v1 release onwards.

## Disclaimer

One of this project's primary objectives is to provide durable modules that support non-breaking migration and upgrade paths. The v0 release (public preview) of the MongoDB Atlas Project Module focuses on gathering feedback and refining the design. Upgrades from v0 to v1 may not be seamless. We plan to deliver a finalized v1 release early next year with long term upgrade support.
